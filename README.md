# Quantitative Strategies for Portfolio Construction & Optimization

This project is a detailed research-oriented suite of Jupyter notebooks designed
to explore key quantitative finance concepts across forecasting, portfolio
optimization, and risk-return analysis. This project explores quantitative
strategies for asset selection, risk-adjusted return optimization, and
out-of-sample validation.  Each notebook tackles a specific area of the asset
management process, from data preprocessing to predictive modeling and convex
optimization.
